A service-level agreement (SLA) is a contract between an external service provider and its customers or between an IT department and the internal business units it serves. The agreement documents what services the provider or IT department will produce and what performance standards the provider or IT department is expected to meet. The performance metrics, or service levels, associated with an SLA are sometimes referred to as service-level objectives (SLOs). SLOs describe, usually in measurable terms, benchmarks or goals set by the parties involved around the services a provider furnishes a customer within a given time period. For example, when used as a call center metric, an SLO might be for the service provider's agents to answer 80% of incoming calls within one minute.


SLAs enable customers and internal business units (collectively referred to here as "customers") to measure service provider or IT department (collectively referred to here as "service provider") performance and confirm that it is delivering services per the contract. SLAs are typically established for each IT service area, such as call center, data center or application maintenance. Customers create SLAs for each service they buy from a service provider, each of which includes a subset of performance metrics.

Although there is no hard and fast rule governing how many SLOs may be included in each SLA, it only makes sense to measure what matters.

Each SLO corresponds with a single performance characteristic relevant to the delivery of an overall service. Some examples of SLOs would include: system availability, help desk incident resolution time and application response time.

Organizations seek to develop SLAs for various reasons. From a simple perspective, an SLA is
developed between two parties to spell out who is responsible for what, what each party will do, and
sometimes more importantly what each party will not do. From a business perspective, an SLA is
developed for these reasons:

• New commercial services entering a competitive market can use SLAs to establish themselves as
reliable providers and hence attract customers.
• Service interactions across organizations increasingly permeate business processes and become
critical to fulfilling business goals. SLAs establish a commitment to quality levels required by
service users and providers to interact effectively. Moreover, SLA management helps customers
validate and supervise the quality of services through scheduled and on-exception reports.
• In one vision of the future, standardized services will be offered by multiple service providers. For
example, realtors provide many different levels of service to home sellers, and all must provide a
minimum level of service. That minimum service might offer use of the Multiple Listing Service
(MLS) for the home at the cost of 1% of the home’s posted sale price. As part of enhanced
service, the realtor might actively market and handle the sale for the owner at the cost of 6 or 7%
percent of the home’s final sale price.
In the context of web services, standardized services may be offered for common well-defined
tasks such as tax return preparation, credit history requests, insurance claims, and banking. A
common SLA that applies to a standard service is an important quality management artifact for
service users and the regulatory agency responsible for overseeing the service.
• Many organizations provide services that depend on services from other organizations. For
example, an online travel-booking system may interact with (1) banks to authorize credit cards,
(2) hotel chains to check availability and reserve rooms, (3) airlines for checking and booking
flights, and (4) car rental companies. In addition, each organization providing a service may, in its
turn, use services from other organizations (commonly called layered or composite services). In
some situations, the unavailability or poor performance of one of the services may compromise
the whole customer experience. In a multi-party composite service situation, SLAs can be used to
identify the party that is responsible in case of a problem.
